NbGit is a module for the NetBeans IDE that adds support for working with the
Git version control system. It uses the JGit library created as part of EGit to
interact with Git repositories. Because the module is Java code all the way, it
should work better cross-platform modulo platform specific differences, such as
file system behavior. It is based on the NetBeans Mercurial module.
